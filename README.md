# Google-Data-Analytics-Certificate-Capstone-Projects
This is a repository that includes my projects in the Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Projects
The projects in this repository are:

1) Cyclistic Bike RideShare: This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate curriculum. This project involves analysing data for dummy bike ride share users in order to advise Cyclistic on how to convert casual riders into annual members. I utilised SQL and PowerBi to get insights from the data.

2) BellaBeat: This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate curriculum. The aim of this project was to analyse sample fitbit data generated for users. This data analysis would help BellaBeat understand how people use fitbit devices in order to come up with a proper marketting stragegy. I utilised R to perform analysis and develop visualisations togain insights from the data.
